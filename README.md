# Vendure Adyen Dropin Plugin

The code of this plugin is inspired by the [Vendure Mollie Plugin](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/tree/b534b31a87ce728bdbbf9d1d37cdc8e528be07c8/packages/payments-plugin/src/mollie).

Our plugin is still in development, but you can test it with your integration to see how Adyen works with your Vendure backend.

You can directly [download the plugin from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mirahi/vendure-adyen-dropin-plugin).
